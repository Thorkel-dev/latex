\section{Presentation}
This document is a simple example of a document generated by \gls{latex}. \newline

It is impossible to present all the possible options with \gls{latex} nor those of the packages used
in this document.
There are other ways to do this that you can find on your own.

\subsection{Minimal installation}
Some packages are necessary to generate the document correctly.
The idea here is to install only the packages that will be useful to us rather than installing the whole package.
\begin{itemize}
    \item latexmk, To automate file compilations
    \item texlive-latex-base, contains packages that are mandated by the core team of \gls{latex}
    \item texlive-latex-extra, contains a very large collection of complementary packages
    \item texlive-font-tools, for image transformation and manipulation
    \item texlive-lang-french, French language support
    \item texlive-lang-english, English language support
    \item biber, bibliographic for \gls{latex}
    \item texlive-bibtex-extra, addition of different style for BibLaTeX
    \item pygments, a generic syntax highlighter adapted to code hosting
    \item plantuml, component that allows to draw quickly diagrams
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Use}
To compile the desired document, you must execute the command \verb=make= in the directory \verb=ebauches/=.
A file with the format \verb=.pdf= is generated at the same level as the \verb=Makefile=. \newline

A \verb=build/= folder is created, it contains all the intermediate compilation files of \gls{latex}.
A file \verb=.dependLatex= and \verb=.dependPlantUML= are created in which the compilation dependencies are listed.
They will allow to speed up the next compilations, by compiling only the modified files.
