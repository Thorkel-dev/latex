\section{Presentation}
This document is a simple example of a document generated by \gls{latex}. \newline

It is impossible to present all the possible options with \gls{latex} nor those of the packages used
in this document.
There are other ways to do this that you can find on your own.

\subsection{Minimal installation}
Some packages are necessary to generate the document correctly. You can install them easily via your
package manager. Some packages may have different names depending on the manager, here are the
package names for Ubuntu. For example : \mintinline{bash}{apt-get install latexmk}.\newline
The idea here is to install only the packages that will be useful to us rather than installing the
whole package.
\begin{itemize}
    \item latexmk, To automate file compilations
    \item texlive-latex-base, contains packages that are mandated by the core team of \gls{latex}
    \item texlive-latex-extra, contains a very large collection of complementary packages
    \item texlive-font-utils, for image transformation and manipulation
    \item texlive-extra-utils, These are various useful supplementary programmes
    \item texlive-lang-french, French language support
    \item texlive-lang-english, English language support
    \item biber, bibliographic for \gls{latex}
    \item texlive-bibtex-extra, addition of different style for BibLaTeX
    \item python3-pygments, a generic syntax highlighter adapted to code hosting
    \item plantuml, component that allows to draw quickly diagrams
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Use in a project}
This is a common template for writing documents. You don't have to modify only the indicated files.

In your git repository, add the git submodule containing the template.
Copy the following files to the directory where you want to write your document:
\begin{itemize}
    \item makefile
    \item latexmkrc
    \item document.tex
    \item tableVersion.tex
    \item acronyms.tex
    \item glossary.tex
    \item biblio.bib
    \item README.md
    \item .gitignore
\end{itemize}

Some files may not be necessary for your document and some may need to be adapted.

\paragraph{Makefile}
The Makefile will recover all the \textbf{.plantuml} to convert them into \textbf{.eps}. See
\ref{plamtuml}, page \pageref{plamtuml} to know how to use it.
Some pathways to files must be adapted to your project.

In the Makefile change the line:
\begin{code}
    \begin{minted}{Makefile}
    SRC_PLANTUML = $(realpath ./schemas)
    to
    SRC_PLANTUML = $(realpath ./<project/path/folder>/schemas)
\end{minted}
    \caption{Makefile change}
\end{code}

\emph{./<project/path/folder>/schemas} is the path to the folder where you will store the various
UML diagrams.\newline

In case these schemas are not needed, you can delete this file, and remove the following line in the
\textbf{latexmkrc} :
\begin{code}
    \begin{minted}{perl}
        # at the start of compilation
        $compiling_cmd = "make eps";
    \end{minted}
    \caption{Delete Makefile}
\end{code}


\paragraph{latexmkrc}
The \textbf{latexmkrc} compiles the file \gls{latex}. See \ref{use}, page \pageref{use} to know how
to use it.
Some pathways to files must be adapted to your project.

In the \textbf{latexmkrc} change the line :
\begin{code}
    \begin{minted}{perl}
    ensure_path("TEXINPUTS", "./param//:", "./figures//");
    to
    ensure_path("TEXINPUTS", "./<project/path/submodule>/param//:", "./<project/path/folder>/submodule/figures//:", "/<project/path/folder>/schemas//:", "/<project/path/folder>/figures//:");
\end{minted}
    \caption{latexmkrc change}
\end{code}

\emph{./<project/path/folder>} is the path to the folders where there are all the Latex source
files, images, ...,.
You can add as many folders as you like as long as they are filled in as above.

\paragraph{document.tex}
This is the central file of your document, the entry point for compilation.
You can rename this file if you wish, but remember to change the following line in the
\textbf{latexmkrc}:

\begin{code}
    \begin{minted}{perl}
        @default_files = ("document.tex");
    \end{minted}
    \caption{Rename file \gls{latex}}
\end{code}

Inside are the parameters given to the \textbf{Parameter} package. See \ref{customization}, page
\pageref{customization} to know how to use it.
The following lines should be replaced by your \gls{latex} files.

\begin{code}
    \begin{minted}{latex}
        %-----------------------------------------
        %            Presentation
        %-----------------------------------------

        % INFO : Add your documentation
        \input{sections/exemple.tex}
    \end{minted}
    \caption{Delete document part}
\end{code}

It is recommended that you use multiple files to separate the different parts rather than putting
everything in one file.

\paragraph{tableVersion.tex}
This file contains a table listing the different versions of the documents. See \ref{Xltabular},
page \pageref{Xltabular} to know how to use it.
In this table, add the versions and their information.
This table will be put in the document.\newline

In case this table is not needed, you can delete this file, and remove the following line in the
\textbf{document.tex}:
\begin{code}
    \begin{minted}{latex}
        \section*{Table of versions}
        \input{tablesVersion.tex} \label{TableOfVersion} % Add the page with the version tables
        \clearpage
    \end{minted}
    \caption{Delete versions table}
\end{code}

\paragraph{acronyms.tex}
This file contains the list of acronyms used in the document. See \ref{acronym}, page
\pageref{acronym} to know how to use it.
These acronyms will be put in the document.\newline

In case these acronyms is not needed, you can delete this file, and remove the following line in the
\textbf{document.tex}:
\begin{code}
    \begin{minted}{latex}
        \loadglsentries{acronyms.tex} % We load the acronyms
        and
        \printglossary[type=\acronymtype, style=superheaderborder] \label{acronyms}
        \glsaddallunused % Even unused acronyms are displayed
    \end{minted}
    \caption{Delete acronyms}
\end{code}

\paragraph{glossary.tex}
This file contains the list of definition used in the document. See \ref{dictionary}, page
\pageref{dictionary} to know how to use it.
This dictionary will be put in the document.\newline

In case this dictionary is not needed, you can delete this file, and remove the following line in
the \textbf{document.tex}:
\begin{code}
    \begin{minted}{latex}
        \loadglsentries{glossary.tex} % We load the dictionary
        and
        \printglossary[] \label{DomainDictionary} % Display the glossary
        \glsaddallunused % Even unused words are displayed
    \end{minted}
    \caption{Delete dictionary}
\end{code}

\paragraph{biblio.bib}
This file contains the list of reference used in the document. See \ref{Biblatex}, page
\pageref{Biblatex} to know how to use it.
This references will be put in the document.\newline

In case this reference is not needed, you can delete this file, and remove the following line in the
\textbf{document.tex}:
\begin{code}
    \begin{minted}{latex}
        \addbibresource{biblio.bib}   % Load the bibliography
        and
        \printbibliography[heading=bibnumbered] \label{bibliography} % Display the bibliography
        \nocite{*} % Even unused references are displayed
    \end{minted}
    \caption{Delete reference}
\end{code}

\subsubsection{Use} \label{use}
To compile the desired document, you must execute, in the directory with the \mintinline{bash}{make}
or the \mintinline{bash}{latexmk}, the command :
\begin{code}
    \begin{minted}{bash}
    make
    or
    latexmk
\end{minted}
    \caption{Generation of document}
\end{code}

If you have deleted the Makefile, the \mintinline{bash}{make} command will not work, use the other
command.\newline

A file with the format \textbf{.pdf} is generated in the \textbf{bin/} folder. Using the
\mintinline{bash}{make} or \mintinline{bash}{latexmk} command gives the same result.
\mintinline{bash}{make} will launch the \mintinline{bash}{latexmk} command which will itself launch
the \mintinline{bash}{make eps} command, see \ref{plamtuml}, page \pageref{plamtuml}.\newline

A \textbf{.temp/} folder is created, it contains all the intermediate compilation files of
\gls{latex}.
A file \textbf{.dependPlantUML} are created in which the compilation dependencies are listed.
They will allow speeding up the next compilations, by compiling only the modified files.

\paragraph{Template customization} \label{customization}
The template uses its own packages for the layout.
They are located in the \textbf{param/} folder.
One is for the front page and the other for the document layout. These two packages have their own
options that will allow you to customize the document.
By filling in the options of \textbf{Parameter} package you also fill in those of
\textbf{FrontPage}. \newline

However, some information must absolutely be filled in. Indeed, they are reused by the packages
afterwards.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb=\title{ }=, defines the title of the document
    \item \verb=\date{ }=, defines the date of the document, today's date is set as default\newline
\end{itemize}

Allows you to customize the footer, header, title...
\begin{itemize}
    \item version, optional, define the current version of the document
    \item reference, optional, define the reference of the document
    \item status, optional, define the status of the document
    \item subject, optional, the subject of the document, will be in the document metadata
    \item keywords, optional, the keywords of the document, will be in the document metadata
    \item language, choice of language for culturally determined typographic rules, by default in
          French \label{language}
    \item encoding, the encoding of the document, by default in utf8
    \item projectName,  optional, the name of the document
\end{itemize}
