\section{Presentation}
This document is a simple example of a document generated by \gls{latex}. \newline

It is impossible to present all the possible options with \gls{latex} nor those of the packages used
in this document.
There are other ways to do this that you can find on your own.

\subsection{Minimal installation}
Some packages are necessary to generate the document correctly.
The idea here is to install only the packages that will be useful to us rather than installing the
whole package.
\begin{itemize}
    \item latexmk, To automate file compilations
    \item texlive-latex-base, contains packages that are mandated by the core team of \gls{latex}
    \item texlive-latex-extra, contains a very large collection of complementary packages
    \item texlive-font-tools, for image transformation and manipulation
    \item texlive-lang-french, French language support
    \item texlive-lang-english, English language support
    \item biber, bibliographic for \gls{latex}
    \item texlive-bibtex-extra, addition of different style for BibLaTeX
    \item pygments, a generic syntax highlighter adapted to code hosting
    \item plantuml, component that allows to draw quickly diagrams
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Use}
To compile the desired document, you must execute the command :
\begin{code}
    \begin{minted}{bash}
    make
    or
    latexmk
\end{minted}
    \caption{Generation of document}
\end{code}

A file with the format \textbf{.pdf} is generated is generated in the \textbf{bin/} folder.
Using the \textbf{make} or \textbf{latexmk} command gives the same result.
\textbf{make} will launch the \textbf{latexmk} command which will itself launch the
\textbf{make eps} command, see \ref{plamtuml}, page \pageref{plamtuml}.\newline

A \textbf{build/} folder is created, it contains all the intermediate compilation files of
\gls{latex}. A file \textbf{.dependPlantUML} are created in which the compilation dependencies are
listed. They will allow to speed up the next compilations, by compiling only the modified files.

\paragraph{Template customization}
The template uses its own packages for the layout.
They are located in the \textbf{param/} folder.
One is for the front page and the other for the document layout.

These two packages have their own options that will allow you to customize the document.
However, some information must absolutely be filled in. Indeed, they are reused by the packages
afterwards.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb=\author{ }=, defines the author of the document
    \item \verb=\title{ }=, defines the title of the document
    \item \verb=\date{ }=, defines the date of the document, today's date is set as default
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{FrontPage}
Allows customization of the front page. If the parameters are optional, an empty space is put in
place
The parameters are :
\begin{itemize}
    \item logoRight, optional, image on top right
    \item logoLeft, optional, image on top left
    \item logoCenter, optional, image in the center
    \item subject, optional, the subject of the document or the subtitle
    \item projectName, optional, the name of the project, is at the bottom left
    \item enterpriseName, optional, the name of the enterprise, is at the bottom left
    \item revision, optional, the revision number of the document, located at the bottom right
    \item version, optional, the version number of the document, located at the bottom right
    \item textColor, The font color of the cover page. By default the color is 0, 0, 60, in rgb.
          To change the color, edit line 24 in the file \textbf{frontPage.sty}. See \textbf{xcolor}
          \ref{color}, page \pageref{color} to change the color
    \item ruleColor, The rule color of the cover page. By default the color is 0, 0, 60, in rgb. To
          change the color, edit line 23 in the file \textbf{frontPage.sty}. See \textbf{xcolor}
          \ref{color}, page \pageref{color} to change the color
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Parameter}
Allows you to customize the footer, header, title...
The parameters are :
\begin{itemize}
    \item imageFooterLeft, optional, image at the bottom left in the footer
    \item imageHeaderLeft, optional, image on top left in the header
    \item subject, optional, the subject of the document, will be in the document metadata
    \item keywords, optional, the keywords of the document, will be in the document metadata
    \item language, choice of language for culturally determined typographic rules, by default in
          french \label{language}
    \item encoding, the encoding of the document, by default in utf8
    \item colorTitle, The font color of the title. By default the color is 0, 0, 60, in rgb. To
          change the color, edit line 91 in the file \textbf{parameter.sty}. See \textbf{xcolor}
          \ref{color}, page \pageref{color} to change the color
    \item ruleColor, The rule color of the cover page. By default the color is 0, 0, 60, in rgb. To
          change the color, edit line 90 in the file \textbf{parameter.sty}. See \textbf{xcolor}
          \ref{color}, page \pageref{color} to change the color
